# Jeremiahs Portfolio

## Description

A short description explaining what the project will do.

- This project is to showcase my work to potential clients or employers.
- I wanted a place to put all of my projects so that they are accessable to anyone who wants to test or view them.
- It uses links to directly test the projects, along with some information about myself such as my familylife, education, passions, and past experiences.
- I have also included tools that I use to build applications.
- Finally I give the user access to different ways to contact me.
