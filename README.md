# Jeremiahs Portfolio

## Description

A short description explaining what the project will do.

- This project is to showcase my work to potential clients or employers.
- I wanted a place to put all of my projects in one place that can be accessable to anyone who     wants to test or view them.
- It uses links to directly test out the projects, along with some information about myself such as, my familylife, education, passions, and past experiences.
- I have also included tools that I use to build applications.
- Finally I gave the user access to different ways to contact me.
